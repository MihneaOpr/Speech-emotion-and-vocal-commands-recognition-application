Emotion Recognition and Vocal Command Android App

Welcome to our Emotion Recognition and Vocal Command Android application! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to recognize emotions from speech and interpret vocal commands. The app is designed to provide an engaging and interactive experience for users while being lightweight and efficient.

Features:

Emotion Recognition: Our Android app uses a state-of-the-art machine learning model that can accurately recognize emotions from speech. It can detect various emotions like happiness, sadness, anger, and more, enhancing the overall user experience.

Vocal Command Interpretation: The app not only recognizes emotions but also interprets vocal commands. Users can interact with the app using voice commands, making it more intuitive and user-friendly.

Trained on RAVDESS and AutoVoice Datasets: The machine learning model has been trained on a rich dataset, including the RAVDESS and AutoVoice datasets. This extensive training ensures better accuracy and reliability in emotion recognition and vocal command interpretation.

Flask Server Backend: To reduce the computational burden on user devices, our model is hosted on a Flask server. This server-client architecture ensures a seamless experience while keeping the app lightweight.

How it works:

Emotion Recognition: To recognize emotions from speech, simply tap the microphone icon and speak a sentence or phrase. The app will quickly process your speech and display the recognized emotions using metrics for all 8 emotions analyzed:neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, surprised.

Vocal Command Interpretation: To use vocal commands, tap the microphone icon and speak your desired command. The app will interpret your command and give as output the command.
